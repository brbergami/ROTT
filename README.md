# BrighterScript based project
This is a template project for a Roku app written in [BrighterScript](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript)

## Setup instructions
1. Install npm dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Build a zip of the project
    ```bash

    ```

## Debugging
This repository comes pre-configured to work with the [BrightScript Language](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language) extension for Visual Studio Code. So once you have that plugin installed, debugging your project is as simple as clicking the "Start Debugging" button.
