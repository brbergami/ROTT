# ROTT
ROTT is a personal OTT channel project made with love using BrightScript, BrighterScript and SceneGraph for fun and educational purposes.

## BrighterScript based project
Written in [BrighterScript](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript) and initially forked from [BrighterScript-Template](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript-template). Collection gallery is from https://jonathanbduval.com, made available inside this repo for HA. My respects to all their works. Icons used are from https://remixicon.com

## Setup instructions
1. Install npm dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Build a zip of the project
    ```bash
    npm run package
    ```

## Debugging
This repository comes pre-configured to work with the [BrightScript Language](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language) extension for Visual Studio Code / VSCodium. So once you have that plugin installed, debugging your project is as simple as clicking the "Start Debugging" button.
